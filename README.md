# GSA-Fall-Hackathon

##Installation

Run these commands at the project root:

```
bower install
npm install
```

Create a database with two tables, ghg_agency and ghg_stats.

Import both .csv files in the /data folder of the same name.

Update lines 11-14 in /server/routes.js with the database connection information.

##Background

Executive Order 13693 -- Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade â€“ has specified that all government agencies must achieve a 30% reduction in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 2025 compared to the 2014 baseline.

Our Quick Look tool dives into the 2014 data on a per-agency basis, showing an overview of an agency's current fleet of vehicles, emissions by each vehicle type in that fleet, and an efficiency analysis of each vehicle type in the fleet.

The final aspect of our tool shows the path the agency could take to reduce their GHG emissions by 30% by 2025.
